This is my test exercise.

I needed to write a script (in Python, obviously) that parses data from 50 event agencies in the Miami area. The script extracts information about these agencies and exports it in .xlsx format, including the following details:

Company Name

Company Website

Email (from Partyslate)

Minimum Spend

Social Links (Instagram, Facebook)

Team Membersâ€™ Information (Names and Job Titles)
